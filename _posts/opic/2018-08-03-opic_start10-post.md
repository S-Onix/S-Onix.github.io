- My father taught me about [운동종류], when I was in elementary school, I learned it at 8. <br/>
At first, It was very hard for me to do it, but eventually, I got it right. <br/>
There were quite a few times I really wanted to give up. <br/>
Now, [운동종류] is fun to me. It is a natural thing to do. It's not a big deal. <br/>
It has become part of my life. There's no doubt that [운동종류] is my No.1 hobby.
